# Playing Around With Rust

This Repo is where I will be storing the Rust code that
I am playing around with in order to learn the language.
My main focus right now is implementing a number of Graph
algorithms, along with the associated data structures.

## Graph Data Structure

An attempt to code all of the typical graph functions in Rust.

## Fibonacci Heap

An outgrowth of the graph data structure. An attempt to implement
the fibonacci heap that provides better O(n) guarantees for Dijkstra's
algorithm.
